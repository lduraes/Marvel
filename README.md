# Basecone iOS Coding Challenge

This challenge is to give us an idea about your coding skills.

## Goal

Build something people would love to use, using your preferred style of code and with the aim of something that you would love to pick up and work on in the future.

Write code that is not only useful but you would be proud of. 

## Values

- We value highly reusable, well-formatted code
- Code efficiency is important for us, but best practices & code readability also.

## The Project

1. Clone this repository. Use it as your working directory.
2. Bootstrap a new app.
3. Request Marvel for an [API key][1].
4. Request the Marvel API a list of characters and parse the JSON response.
5. Display a list of characters, each entry should show
	- picture
	- character name
	- description
6. Request only 10 characters at a time. Use an endless list with a load more mechanism. The load more should be triggered when the scrolling is close to reaching the end of the list.
7. Cache the characters in a persistent storage.
9. On a click you should navigate to the character details. There's no need to show everything the API returns but would be nice to know the movies the character participated in.
9. On a long click on a list item show a dialog to ask if go to the `detail` or the `wiki` from the `urls` which is opened then in the browser.

## Submission

You have 3 days to complete the exercise, but we hope you don't spend more than a day on this.

The project is open ended but don’t rush to completion to send something without polish. If you run out of available time, just do a good job on the parts you completed.

When you’re finished, we'd prefer you to commit the project to Github where we can access it. Alternatively, you can zip up the project and send that to us.


Feel free to surprise us and remember to have fun!

Send us an email when you’re done so we can take a look at it before we follow up with you. 

Please reach out if you have any questions.

## Additional notes

- Functionality above must be implemented using common architectural patterns.
- The business logic should be tested by unit tests.
- We love open source so feel free to use whatever feels right for you.
- If there are special instructions, comments or installation needs document them appropriately in a `notes` file.
- If you want to use different branches, please make sure that they'll be merged into master branch when you'll finish the task.


## Bonus points
- Provide a comprehensive git history.
- A reactive approach.
- UI tests
- Certificate pinning
- Search functionality
